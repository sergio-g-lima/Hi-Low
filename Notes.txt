Program.cs was created as a proof of concept. 

To extend this to a multiple player game we would need to convert this to a webapi, with implemented security.

On that API we could have:
- An endpoint to matches 2 players to play against each other 
(server generates a number and players take turns guessing until someone wins)
- signalR comunication with both clients to notify each player of the other player choices
- minimum / maximum stored in database to customize default dificulty
- each game would have a database entry to store game evolution, and store results in the long run
- There could be top 10 lists for best guessers, most active players, etc.
